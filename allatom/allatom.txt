The following parameters describe the CNS parameters for the OPLSX forcefield (from parallhdg5.3.pro in the HADDOCK distribution):

In CNS, the first parameter is epsilon and the second is sigma. These
parameters are used directly in a 12-6 LJ potential: vdw = 4*epsilon(rr**12-rr**6),
where rr is sigma/r. This is used directly for homo-atom-type interactions.
For hetero-type interactions, the mean radius of sigma is used, while the geometric mean radius of epsilon is used (sqrt(eps1*eps2)).

In CNS, you can also directly describe the interaction parameters between two types, using the NBFIX statement. In this case, you need to supply the parameters A and B, where A = 4*epsilon*sigma**12 and B = 4*epsilon*sigma**6, so that the interaction energy can be simply expressed as A/r**12 - B/r**6.
