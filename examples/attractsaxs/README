These are example files for running ATTRACT-SAXS on a binary complex
as described in

Schindler, de Vries, Sasse, Zacharias. SAXS data alone can generate
high-quality models of protein-protein complexes. Structure (2016).

-----------------
*** Input ***
-----------------

1) Experimental SAXS profile in inverse Angstrom with error column
2) PDB structures of the two proteins of interest

---------------------
**** Requirements ****
---------------------
You need to have the ATTRACT software installed. Follow the instructions in INSTALLATION.txt

In addition to the normal requirements for ATTRACT, you need to have the following software/packages installed:

CUDA
pycuda, itertools
ATSAS


then add to your .bashrc

export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$ATTRACTTOOLS/saxs
export ATSASDIR=/yourpath/to/ATSAS/bin


----------------------
**** ATTRACT-SAXS ***
---------------------

The run-all.sh script contains all steps that are necessary for ATTRACT-SAXS. 
It expects an experimental SAXS profile (exp-ori.dat) and structures of 
two proteins (ubA.pdb, ubB.pdb).

protocol.sh runs ATTRACT-SAXS sampling without C1 fitting during SAXS scoring. 
protocol-fit.sh contains the same steps with additional C1 fitting.

------------------------
***** Example ********
------------------------

To test ATTRACT-SAXS, change to the 2GTP directory and type

bash ../run-all.sh
