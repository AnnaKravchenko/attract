ATTRACT is developed under Linux. It should work under Mac OSX, but this has not been tested.
It does not work under Microsoft Windows.

Installation instructions for Linux:

1. Install g++ and gfortran (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install g++ gfortran).

2. Go into "attract/bin", "make all" or "make all -j4" (if you have 4 cores).
This should create the attract binary. See step 7 to compile ATTRACT with support for GPU acceleration.

3. Export the ATTRACT environment variables. In your .bashrc file, add the following:
  export ATTRACTDIR=/home/user/attract/bin (i.e. wherever you installed attract)
  export ATTRACTTOOLS=$ATTRACTDIR/../tools
  export ATTRACTGUI=$ATTRACTDIR/../gui
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ATTRACTDIR:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

4. For the analysis, also install numpy and scipy (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy)

5. For iATTRACT and the OPLSX forcefield, install pdb2pqr (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install pdb2pqr)
In addition, the pdb2pqr directory must be made accessible to Python. (Under Ubuntu, this directory is
/usr/share/pdb2pqr . It should contain the files "pdb2pqr.py" and "main.py".)
To make it accessible, edit your .bashrc file (/home/user/.bashrc) by adding the following
  export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/share/pdb2pqr

6. Test your installation.
Type "source ~/.bashrc" (or start a new command line shell).
After step 1 and 2, typing "$ATTRACTDIR/attract" should result in:
  Too few arguments
  usage: $path/attract structures.dat parameterfile receptor.pdb [ligand.pdb] [options]
After step 3, typing "python -c 'import numpy, scipy' " should give no error.
After step 4, typing "python -c 'import pdb2pqr' " should give no error.

Optional steps:

7. GPU support
- Install the CUDA toolkit. For more information visit "https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit".
  In particular, you should have the following variables added to your .bashrc:
    export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda
    export PATH=$PATH:$CUDADIR/bin
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$CUDADIR/lib64
- Install the boost coroutine and system libraries (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libboost-coroutine-dev libboost-system-dev).
- Repeat step 2. This should generate the emATTRACT, mcATTRACT and gpuATTRACTcheck binaries.
- Check that GPU support is enabled successfully by running the gpuATTRACTcheck binary.

9. PyPy
Some ATTRACT tools will run considerably faster if you install PyPy
(under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install pypy)

9. Spydersilk support
With Spydersilk, you can edit ATTRACT protocol files (.web files) locally.
- Get the Spydersilk code (under Ubuntu: wget http://www.attract.ph.tum.de/services/ATTRACT/downloads/spydersilk-0.03.tar.gz)
- Install pip (under Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-pip)
- Install Spydersilk: sudo pip install spydersilk-0.03.tar.gz
- To test that it works, type "cd $ATTRACTGUI; python -c 'import spyder, attractmodel'"
